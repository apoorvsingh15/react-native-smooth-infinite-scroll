# React Native Infinite Scroll

Scrolling a list in react native can become pretty tidious if we do not take care of
performance aspects involved in the process.

Using the traditional scrollview is not viable options as it makes the scrolling really choppy
which inturn can hamper the experience of the user.

Here I have tried to demonstrate with the help of a simple expamle the power of flatList in
react native and the associate benefits which it brings with it.

Here is the screenshot of working demo
